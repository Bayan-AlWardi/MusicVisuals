## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
This assignment showcases a visually captivating and funky representation of a song. The provided code employs various visualization techniques to create an immersive and engaging visual experience that complements the music. The code incorporates different modes of visualization, each offering its unique visual effects. These effects are carefully crafted to capture the energy and vibe of the music, resulting in a cool and vibrant visual representation. As the song plays, the visuals come to life, dynamically responding to the rhythm, tempo, and other elements of the music. The code utilizes techniques like amplitude analysis, frequency mapping, and rhythmic patterns to generate visually appealing and synchronized effects. The visual representation generated by the code is meant to enhance the listening experience, adding an extra layer of excitement and enjoyment. It creates a multisensory encounter where the audience can not only hear but also see the music come alive in a funky and visually stimulating manner. Overall, this assignment combines the power of sound and visuals to create a funky and visually mesmerizing representation of a song, resulting in an immersive and dynamic experience for the audience.

# Instructions
Run the code:
Open the Processing sketch and click the "Run" button or press "Ctrl+R" (or "Cmd+R" on Mac) to start the visualizations.

Explore visualization modes:
Press the number keys (1, 2, 3, 4) to switch between different visualization modes.
Each mode offers a unique visual effect, so feel free to try them out and see which one you like best.

Control the audio:
Press the spacebar to pause/play the audio.
This allows you to pause the music and focus solely on the visualizations, or resume the audio playback.

Observe and enjoy:
As the song plays, watch how the visuals respond to the music.
Notice how the colors, shapes, and movements change in sync with the audio input.

# How it works
The visuals created by the provided code can be related to the song "Mantra" by interpreting the visuals in a way that captures the essence and mood of the song. Here's a possible interpretation:
Sphere (Mode 1):
The dynamic lines and vibrant colors of the sphere visualization can represent the energetic and pulsating nature of the song "Mantra."
The changing positions and lengths of the lines can mirror the rhythmic patterns and melodic movements in the music.
The size and color variations of the dots can symbolize the different layers and frequencies present in the song, adding depth and complexity to the visual representation.

Sound Particles (Mode 2):
The moving particles in this visualization can symbolize the repetitive and trance-like nature of the song "Mantra."
The particles' movements and sizes can follow the pulsating beats and subtle variations in the music, creating a mesmerizing and hypnotic visual effect.
The changing colors of the particles can correspond to the shifting tones and emotions in the song, reflecting its introspective and evocative qualities.

Spiral Nodes (Mode 3):
The spiral pattern and fluid movements of the nodes can represent the continuous and cyclical nature of the song "Mantra."
The nodes' interactions and bouncing movements can convey a sense of harmony and synchronization with the music.
The changing thickness and color of the lines connecting the nodes can symbolize the intricate layers and textures in the song's composition, adding a sense of complexity and depth to the visual representation.

CDWaves (Mode 4):
The circular waves in this visualization can signify the expansive and transformative qualities of the song "Mantra."
The size and color variations of the waves can capture the ebb and flow of intensity and emotion throughout the song.
The central circle representing the audio source can symbolize the core mantra or recurring motif in the music, while the surrounding waves reflect the subtle variations and harmonies that build upon it.
By relating the visuals to the song's characteristics, such as its energy, repetition, cyclical nature, and transformative qualities, the visualizations can enhance the listener's experience and provide a synchronized and immersive representation of the song "Mantra."

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
Fajar:
I am proud of the code's responsiveness to the audio input. The visualizations dynamically adjust based on the amplitude, frequency, and rhythm of the music. This synchronization between the visuals and the music creates a seamless and coherent experience, where the visuals and music complement each other perfectly. Furthermore, this project helped me to gain better understanding of git.
